# hello-world
I am a Tampa based lawyer with de la Pena & Holiday, LLP.  My practice specializes in start up and emerging growth companies in tech.  My primary focus is business formation and business finance with an emphasis on cryptocurrency, blockchain, and smart contracts.  Having completed an LLM in Business Transactions from the University of Alabama, I am now shifting my focus to working on developing coding skills to provide a foundation to contribute more to this emerging technology.
